# Additional Text

This could be a simple introductionary text, which will be used during a lecture to let people read by themselves.

One way would be to have a text which is a rough overview  in the beginning or a summary in the end.
This would fulfill the criteria for having at least a small theory part. 

Of course you can also have the theory part in another way, like inside a Jupyter notebook, or as a presentation by the teacher.
